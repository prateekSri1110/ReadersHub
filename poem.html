                <br>Time flies, you sit under the sky
                <br> And watching it go, you just cry
                <br> You watch that moon and remember him
                <br> That why didn’t he even give it a try
                <br>
                <br> There you forget to notice those stars
                <br> Who could have helped your scars to dry
                <br> You think every word he said to you
                <br> And calculate how much of it was a lie
                <br>
                <br> You forget to appreciate happy times
                <br> And never told him a healthy goodbye
                <br> You put up big barriers in front of you
                <br> And pretend that you need no guy
                <br>
                <br> Somewhere you want to strongly believe
                <br> Forever isn’t always a lie
                <br> You want to believe that a guy will come
                <br> And Things will change with just his hii
                <br>
                <br> You’ll want to believe that love isn’t bad
                <br> When you’ll think if he should get a reply
                <br> You’ll want to believe he’ll stay by your side
                <br> Even in bad state you’ll deny
                <br>
                <br> Maybe you’ll compare him to your ex
                <br> And think what if you retry
                <br> But you couldn’t and should not go back
                <br> To live what was just a lie
                <br>
                <br> You have to open up and let people in
                <br> As it will be time to get up and fly!!
                <br> You must believe love was not that failed
                <br> So, you must not give up and just try!

                <br>There was a time where we had no teeth,
                <br>With no fear, we have to earn to eat!
                <br>There was a time where r hands were legs
                <br>With no thought, money makes them beg
                <br>
                <br>People wanted to see us laugh and smile
                <br>Now can’t see r happy faces for a while!
                <br>I remember my elders offering me gift
                <br>Now what I see isn’t a quarrel but a rift
                <br>
                <br>Once, there were friends all around
                <br>Assuming that friendship has no bounds
                <br>Now what I see r a few people together
                <br>Who change themselves just like a weather
                <br>
                <br>There was a time when no one betrayed
                <br>All the hidden grudges used to slowly fade
                <br>Now people just separate their ways
                <br>How easily they move on, I often amaze
                <br>
                <br>Life was life then, now it’s just a ride
                <br>All what a person need is his own pride
                <br>Feelings of others r no more important
                <br>Now change has become d only constant

                <br>Besides a listener, I am a Sayer.
                <br>
                <br>They say I lie,
                <br>They say I don’t cry.

                <br>I was happy, I bet he was too!
                <br>I loved him once, surely, he did too,

                <br>Now he is angry, I have my rage too...
                <br>
                <br>He meant world, I was his too,
                <br>When I laughed, he smiled too.

                <br>He was a mistake, I was a lesson too.
                <br>
                <br>I was childish, sometimes he was too,
                <br>When I used to irritate, he annoyed too.
                <br>But now no one withstand our stupidness,
                <br>I miss him, maybe he does too.
                <br>
                <br>He was not bad, maybe I wasn’t too.
                <br>Just, I wasn’t for him, he might wasn’t too,

                <br>There was a day with endless rain,
                <br>Night filled with excruciating pain.
                <br>It wasn’t a dream but a metaphor,
                <br>Filled with fears of one insane.
                <br>She felt boiling blood in her veins,
                <br>She knew there was fret in her brain.
                <br>She could see him there, lying lifeless,
                <br>But, tries to save him were going in vain.
                <br>
                <br>Her life then turned to a moving train,
                <br>A train that can’t choose a single lane.
                <br>She saw close people in her life go,
                <br>She had no thoughts, that help her sustain.
                <br>She fought herself, she tried to refrain,
                <br>She tried to find her happiness again.
                <br>Yes, surely she found reasons to do so,
                <br>But u know, it’s difficult to remove some stains.
                <br>
                <br>These nightmares come with no constrains,
                <br>She fears but fights them without complain.
                <br>She does try hard to forget dreadful past,
                <br>But there’s a part of guilt, that always remain.
                <br>Maybe someday peace her heart will attain,
                <br>Someday strengths her dreams will regain,
                <br>Maybe someday she’ll wake up with a smile,
                <br>And share it with someone with a glass of champagne!

                <br>There must be something about you,

                <br>From sun’s first ray, till the lights turned dim.
                <br>I actually hoped he’ll love too,
                <br>N stand by my side through my thick n thin!
                <br>
                <br>I remember the day we met,
                <br>I felt butterflies hopping in my heart!
                <br>There was a spark in my eyes,
                <br>But I knew it’ll end before it starts.
                <br>
                <br>We were irreparably broken,
                <br>The last thing we wished was to love again.
                <br>I had to pretend to shut my love,
                <br>His smile was enough, though I lived in pain.
                <br>
                <br>I just wish to see him happy,
                <br>I wish, to his miseries, I could be cure!
                <br>I wish he realises someday soon,
                <br>What I feel for him is real and sure.
